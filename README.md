This is the final version of a heart rate simulator made with myself and two individuals. The project uses C++ and QTCreator to develop an application that simulates a
device that monitors a user’s heart rate and provides the user with real-time feedback on their
heart health Application analyses text files of the user’s heart rate data to calculate and displays the user’s
heart rate variability patterns and coherence levels in the form of a real-time updating HRV graph.
